# HW_R
Homework on the "Descriptive statistics with R" University course.

It mostly consists of data visualization methods. Also, there are topics on cluster analysis and principal components.

### Lab 1
* Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance, quantiles, etc) for 2 variables by hand and using R, then compare the results

### Lab 2
* Data manipulation and visualisation with histograms, box-whiskers plots

### Lab 3
* Visualize the data on the world map

### Lab 4
* Visualize correlation maps for different types of correlation - Pearson, Spearman, Kendall
* Highlight the clusters of highly correlated variables
* Observe the correlation using scatter plots and correlation graphs

### Lab 5
* Perform PCA - principal component analysis
* Visualize principal components in 2D and 3D plots

### Lab 6 
* Form the clusters using PCA, dendrogram and different kinds of distance - Euclidean, Manhattan
* Visualize clusters of variables on scatterplots, histograms, etc
